-- 
-- comment:
--   This module is a programmable divider use for generating the sample clock
--   (clk_samp). It continuously counts down from pre_clk_tx-1 to 0, asserting
--   en_clk_samp during the 0  count.
--   
-- To ensure proper reset of the FFs running on the derived clock,
--   en_clk_samp is asserted during  reset.
--   
--  Notes:
--   pre_clk_tx must be at least 2 for this module to work. Since it is not
--   allowed to be less than 32 (by the parser), this is not a problem.
