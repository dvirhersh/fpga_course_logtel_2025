--   UART transmit  controller
--   Implements the state machines for doing RS232  transmission.
--   
-- Whenever a character is ready for transmission (as indicated by  the
--   empty signal from the character FIFO), this module will transmit  the
--    character.
--   
-- The basis of this design is a simple state machine. When in IDLE,  it
--   waits for the character FIFO to indicate that a character is  available,
--   at which time, it immediately starts transmition. It spends  16
--   baud_x16_en periods in the START state, transmitting the  START
--   condition (1'b0), then tranisitions to the DATA state, where it  sends
--   the 8 data bits (LSbit first), each lasting 16 baud_x16_en periods,  and
--   finally going to the STOP state for 16 periods, where it transmits  the
--   STOP value  (1'b1).
--   
-- On the last baud_x16_en period of the last data bit (in the  DATA
--   state), it issues the POP signal to the character FIFO. Since the SM  is
--   only enabled when baud_x16_en is asserted, the resulting pop  signal
--   must then be ANDed with baud_x16_en to ensure that only one  character
--   is popped at a time.  
--   
-- On the last baud_x16_en period of the STOP state, the empty  indication
--   from the character FIFO is inspected; if asserted, the SM returns  to
--   the IDLE state, otherwise it transitions directly to the START state  to
--   start the transmission of the next  character.
--   
-- There are two internal counters - one which counts off the 16 pulses  of
--   baud_x16_en, and a second which counts the 8 bits of  data.
--   
-- The generation of the output (txd_tx) follows one complete  baud_x16_en
--   period after the state machine and other internal  counters.
--   
-- Multicycle and False  Paths
--   All flip-flops within this module share the same chip enable,  generated
--   by the Baud rate generator. Hence, all paths from FFs to FFs in  this
--   module are multicycle  paths.
