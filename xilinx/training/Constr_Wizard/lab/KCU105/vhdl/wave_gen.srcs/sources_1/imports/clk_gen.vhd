-- comment:
--   This module is the clock generator for the  design.
--   It takes in a single clock input (nominally 100MHz), and  generates
--   three output clocks using a single clock generator:
--     clk_rx   - running at the same frequency as the input clock
--     clk_tx   - either running at hte same frequency as the input clock
--                or running at 31/32 times the frequency
--   clk_samp   - a decimated version of clk_tx using a BUFHCE (from clk_tx)
--              - running at 1/prescale the frequency of clk_tx
